# DFQ-Original

DFQ-Original is a basic version of [Dungeon & Fighter·Quest (DFQ)](https://tieba.baidu.com/f?kw=%B0%A2%C0%AD%B5%C2%D3%A2%D0%DB%B4%AB), it's a coterie game of [DNF](http://dnf.qq.com).

## Build

DFQ makes with [LÖVE(0.10.2)](http://love2d.org), you can [download it](https://bitbucket.org/rude/love/downloads/) and learn [how to run](http://love2d.org/wiki/Getting_Started).

## Code Standards

DFQ has own-style code standards, see below:

* Private variable: prefixed with `_` => `_a`
* Function & Class: prefixed with capital letter => `Test()`
* Module (A table but not class): all capital letter => `MAP`

And DFQ use a code hinting plugin named [EmmyLua](https://github.com/EmmyLua/VSCode-EmmyLua), so you can see some comments such like `---@xxx`.
